            <h3>Rule of thirds</h3>
            <p>A rule of thumb for composing visual images in which either
            the first or last third of the image contains the subject, thus
            leaving the other two-thirds free and more open.</p>
            <img src="images/WDD230_RuleOfThirds.png" alt="woman on vacation">
            <a href="https://mediaboom.com/news/travel-advertising/ "><br>Mediaboom</a><br><br>
           <p>In the image rule of thirds is seen in the left side of the
            image with the woman who serves as the subject taking up the
            first third on that side, and the rest being given empty space
            that makes the image feel more empty and less crowded.</p><hr>

            <h3>White space and clean design</h3>
            <p>White space is the empty unused part of a design, while
            clean design is the term for precise and uncluttered images that
            are created from the careful placement of elements with these images.</p>

            <p>This design makes use of white space and clean design to draw
            greater focus to the text and centered images, which helps to
            further draw the viewers attention and intrigue in the product
            being advertised.</p><hr>

            <h3>PARC: contrast</h3>
            <p>Artistic appeal created from the arrangement of two differing
            elements, such as opposite colors or font styles.</p>
            <img src="images/WDD230_Contrast.png" alt="coca cola">
            <a href="https://us.coca-cola.com/"><br>Coca Cola</a><br><br>
            <p>The Coca Cola design above shows contrast through the difference
            in coloring of the red and white in this image, which not only makes
            it more appealing by adding a greater variety of colors to the image
            but also helps to draw in customers through the use of the white text
            on a red background.</p>
